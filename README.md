### About The Project
Made Easy is an application that brings artisans with expertise in a particular field, and 
individuals who need services from a particular field together.
Whereby clients can search for artisans of their own interest, with skills the client is in need 
of. A client can request services from one artisan at a time and an artisan can provide 
services to one client at a time. 
Every new artisan registers with their email address and creates their own password to 
access their account. The artisan will disclose their skills, contact details, city which they 
reside in and a picture of themselves. 
Every new client registers with their email address and creates their own password to access
their account. The clients will disclose their contact details, city which they reside in and a 
picture of themselves.
Clients are able to provide ratings and comments for the services provided by the respective 
artisan. Artisans are also able to provide ratings and comments on the experience they had 
in providing services to the respective client. Each rating along with its comment is made by 
a client/artisan to an artisan/client. An artisan can get and make many ratings and 
comments and a client and make and get many ratings and comments.
